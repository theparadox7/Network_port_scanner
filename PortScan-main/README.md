# PortScan
Simple Python3 port scanner

Simply scans for open ports on a given IP address. 

Accepts port ranges to search for. 

Build it into an exe using *Pyinstaller --onefile PortScan.py* or execute via command line *python3 PortScan.py*.

Or use the CLI version, which can be executed like so: *python3 PortScan-CLI.py IP_ADDRESS START_PORT END_PORT* -- using enviornment variables you can shorten this to whatever desired.

TODO: GUI, hostname scanning support.
